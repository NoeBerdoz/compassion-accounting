This module adds a way to implement off-balance sponsorship accounting.
Sponsorship generate invoices to enable off balance accounting (which can be required in certain legislation)
we cannot rely on the odoo off-balance account feature (it does not allow a reconcilable account)
2 accounts are defined in the sponsorship config: Account asset and an reconcilable account.
This enable to have the full set of accounts from invoice generation to payment, all off the main chart of account.

The income to be reported in the accounting is to be done in batch, once payments are in.
