It's not possible to use the stock off-balance feature because it's not
possible to have a reconciliable off-balance account. So we use the 9xxx
account and a configuration to define: - receivable (off-balance): A -
asset (off-balance): B this function adds in the payment move if there
is an off-balance (A) receivable account: - the off-balance asset (B) -
add the outstanding account again.
